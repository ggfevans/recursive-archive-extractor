# Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure

## Objectives
- Set up comprehensive testing framework
- Create test fixtures and samples
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility

## Steps

### 1. Setup Testing Framework
- [ ] Configure pytest
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting
- [ ] Create test utilities
- [ ] Implement test configurations

### 2. Create Test Cases
- [ ] Unit tests:
    - Archive detection tests
    - Extraction process tests
    - CLI functionality tests
    - Configuration tests
- [ ] Integration tests:
    - End-to-end workflows
    - Error handling scenarios
    - Performance tests
- [ ] Create mock objects and fixtures
- [ ] Add platform-specific tests

### 3. Create Sample Archives
- [ ] Generate test archives:
    - Various formats
    - Nested archives
    - Corrupted archives
    - Password-protected archives
- [ ] Create test data sets
- [ ] Add sample configurations

### 4. Setup CI/CD
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions:
    - Test workflow
    - Lint workflow
    - Build workflow
- [ ] Add automated releases
- [ ] Implement version management
- [ ] Create deployment pipeline

## Success Criteria
- [ ] High test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] All tests passing on all platforms
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functioning
- [ ] Automated releases working

## Notes
- Focus on edge cases
- Ensure reproducible tests
- Document test requirements
